# pepper-species-classification
This project develops a pepper species classification using PyTorch and Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Description
This project involves the development of a **Pepper Species Classification System** using **PyTorch** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify different species of peppers based on images. This is a challenging task due to the wide variety of pepper species and the subtle differences in their physical characteristics.

## Applications
The applications of this project are vast and impactful. Here are a few key ones:
1. **Agriculture**: Farmers can use this system to identify the species of peppers they are growing or planning to grow. This can help them make informed decisions about crop rotation, pest control, and other farming practices.
2. **Biodiversity Conservation**: By identifying and cataloging different pepper species, we can contribute to biodiversity conservation efforts. This is particularly important for rare or endangered pepper species.
3. **Culinary Industry**: Chefs and food enthusiasts can use this system to identify pepper species, helping them choose the right peppers for their dishes based on flavor, heat level, and other characteristics.

## Methodology
The methodology for this project involves several steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Collect a large dataset of pepper images. The images are be labeled with the correct species of the pepper it contains.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the images to make them suitable for input into a CNN. This involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.

3. **Model Building**: Use a pretrained ResNet-18 model as the base for the CNN. The ResNet-18 model has been pre-trained on a large dataset and can extract complex features from images. Add a new fully connected layer at the end to perform the classification.

4. **Training**: Train the CNN on the preprocessed image data. Use a suitable loss function (including cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification), and an optimization algorithm (ase stochastic gradient descen).

5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate test set of images. 

6. **Fine-tuning and Optimization**: Based on the evaluation results, the model parameters and architecture was fine-tune for better performance. This involve adjusting the learning rate, adding regularization and increasing the model complexity.

This project combines the power of deep learning with the versatility of PyTorch and the efficiency of pretrained models to tackle a real-world classification problem. It's a great example of how AI can be used to aid in agriculture and biodiversity conservation.
